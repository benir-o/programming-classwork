# The Programming Classwork Repository

This repository covers `60-70%` of the work I do on a daily or weekly basis, although I have other repositories that contain more specific projects. This repository covers key concepts in Java such as Object Oriented Programming, Streams API and Algorithms and data structures. There are many folders and subfolders covering these topics in detail. 

## 📁 Repository Structure

### `⭕Algorithms`
<p>
  The folder contains topics discussing algorithms and data structueres such as linked lists, as well as their implementation. 
  The folders are structured as follows:
</p>

- `Array Structures`
- `Binary Search`
- `Linked Lists`
- `Hash Maps`

### `🔨Assets`
Contains diagrams and documentation on the topics covered.

### `🧮Grades Calculator Project`
This is one of the personal projects i took to try and enhance my Object Oriented Programming skills. <br>
The structure is as follows: 
- `Refactorization`
- `Students Grading System`

### `🌐Login System Project`
Here I build a simple login page that allows users to enter their username and passwords in order to gain access on a page.

### `Object Oriented Programming Introduction`
They included projects guided by <a href="https://codewithmosh.com/">`Mosh Hamedani`</a> as well as personal classwork projects.
The folder structure is as follows: <br>
- `A simple loan System`
- `Dice Rolls`
- `Employee Relations in OOP`
