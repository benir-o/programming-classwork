'''
A set is an unordered mutable collection of unique elements
Sets are useful when we want to store a group of items
without any duplicates and don't need to maintain any specific
order.

They are defined using curly braces {} or the set () constructor, with items
separated by commas

A Ques is a linear data structure that utilizes the first in-first out principle. 
In a queue, the first element that is added is the first one to be removed-just
like people waiting in a line
New elements are added at the rear (end), and elements are removed from the front
(beginning). 
Queues can be implemented using lists, collections.deque, or linked lists in python.
